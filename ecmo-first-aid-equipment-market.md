<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ECMO First Aid Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ECMO First Aid Equipment market comprises two main types: Veno-Arterial (VA) ECMO and Veno-Venous (VV) ECMO. VA ECMO is utilized to support both cardiac and respiratory function by routing blood from a vein and returning it to an artery, mainly used in cases of cardiac failure. VV ECMO primarily supports pulmonary function by draining blood from a vein and returning it to another vein, making it suitable for patients with severe respiratory distress. Both types are critical in life-threatening scenarios.</p></p>
